# What is VisualBox?

[VisualBox](https://visualbox.io) is an **integration and visualization tool** that runs in your web browser. You can add integrations that fetch, process and generate data models. Widgets can be connected to data models and visualize them in dashboards.

### For What is VisualBox?

VisualBox is for visualizing any kind of data. You can for example:

- query data from databases
- query data from different API's and combine them
- stream live data from IoT devices
- process videos or images

VisualBox maintains a **public registry** for integrations and widgets which lets you re-use crowdsourced implementations. You can fork registry items and extend or modify the functionality to suit your own needs. VisualBox utilizes [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build an image of the source code that can be run as a container on the back-end. Different **templates** are available to get you quickly started.

Available templates:

- Node.js 11
- Python 3
- Go

...and more are added all the time! If you find yourself missing a language or environment in the template list you can contribute and add it to the [VisualBox templates](https://github.com/visualbox/visualbox-templates) repository.

### Why is it Running in the Web Browser?

There are no installation steps required. You can create and view dashboards on any computer as long as you have an internet connection. Compute heavy tasks are offloaded to the back-end service.
