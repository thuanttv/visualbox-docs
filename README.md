# What is VisualBox?

[VisualBox](https://visualbox.io) is an **integration and visualization tool** that runs in your web browser. You can add integrations that fetch, process and generate data models. Widgets can be connected to data models and visualize them in dashboards.

### For What is VisualBox?

VisualBox is for visualizing any kind of data. You can for example:

- query data from databases
- query data from different API's and combine them
- stream live data from IoT devices
- process videos or images

VisualBox maintains a **public registry** for integrations and widgets which lets you re-use existing implementations. You can fork registry items and extend or modify the functionality to suit your own needs. Different **runtimes** are supported for integrations to run in:

- Node.js 11
- Python 3
- Go

...and more are added all the time!

### Why is it Running in the Web Browser?

There is no installation step. You can create and view dashboards on any computer as long as you have an internet connection.
